# Explain the difference between immutable and mutable types in Python. How does this apply to strings?
"""
In Python language, data types can be either mutable or immutable. Those data types that can be changed or modified
after creation are mutable types, and those data types that cannot be changed or modified after creation are immutable
types. Strings are immutable types in Python.

# Describe the role of escape characters in Python strings. Give examples.
"""
To represent strings, single quotes or double quotes are used in Python. However, if these quotes are a part
of the string itself, then the compiler might get confused about the start and end of the string. For clarity, escape
characters are used. An escape character is a backslash (\\) followed by a character that has a special meaning like a
quotes, a newline, including a backslash itself as part of the string.
